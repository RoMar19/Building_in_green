## UI

**Colors, Fonts & Layout**
The layout was based on a Theme template from startbootstrap.com, 
after removing all Bootstrap components creating conflicts with Materialize,
new style appied.
Colors and Fonts from mystyle.css to customize
the website.

## Technologies used

This Green Building web application was built using:
### Languages:
**HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript** was used to build an interactive webpage.

**Python** was used to build the structure and functionality of the back end.

### Libraries to style interactive options:

* FontAwesome
* jQuery
* Dnspython
* Materialize to make the structure and site responsive in a simple manner. 
* Flask used to display python functions on the website.
* Pymongo to make the code written in python talk to the database.

### Tools:
**MongoDB** was used as the database host.

### Deployment/Host:

**Heroku** was used to deploy the live version of the application.

The website is built and developed using **GitPod** as IDE.

### Testing:
* W3C's HTLM Validator

* W3C's CSS Validator

* Responsinator 

* JSHint

## Deployment
GitPod was used as IDE to develop this application. Throughout the development, the project was 
committed to the git and continuously pushed automatically to Heroku connected to GitHub. 

**Deploy to Heroku**
Steps to deploy the application on Heroku:

* Login to my Heroku
* Click on "new" in the top right corner and choose "create new app"
* Choose the name of the application and set "Region" to Europe. Click "Create app"
* Go to settings and add the config vars PORT (5000) and IP (0.0.0.0)
* Login on Heroku through the CLI in your IDE.
* Add the project as a master branch
* Push to Heroku (git push)
* For Heroku to be able to run the app a Procfile and a requirements.txt must be created 
  which is done in the IDE. 

## Testing

**W3C's HTLM Validator** used to validate the websites HTML code.

**W3C's CSS Validator** used to validate the websites CSS code.

**JSHint** used to validate the websites JavaScript code.

**Responsinator** used to check responsiveness.

Pages work as expected in a responsive manner. All select options, forms and buttons tested. 
Only a function to clear the selected categories in the dropdown is yet to be implemented. 
When user select an option from the dropdown, after displaying the selection, dropdown does not show
all the possible options to selected again. User has to click any other nav link to refresh select options. 
Clear/refresh dropdown function must be implemented in future.

## Comments
It was a very frustrating experience to mix Bootstraap and Materlialize from wich I have learned the lesson.
It was causing big difficults to style and get a proper wesite layout until find out that it is not possible to mix both style libraries.
